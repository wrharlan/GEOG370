    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:red"></h2>
    <p>This world map can be projected in many ways based upon what information the user wants 
        to know. The QGIS program with the help of the Indicatrix Mapper allowed me to create several 
        different versions of the same map. The projections were manipulated by changing the 
        Coordinate Reference System or CRS, resulting in the various projections that can be seen
        below. After figuring out how to display the map in one specific projection, it became easier
        to test and see new projections. 
         </p>
    
    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>The WGS84 projection is a very widely used projection because the Global Positioning System or GPS
        uses this as its coordinate reference system. This projection maintains area at the expense of
        shape. This can be seen towards the poles with the horizontal stretching of land.

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection seeks to mitigate distortion by elongating the poles. Although better than some other
        projections, there is still some vertical stretching that interferes with the natural shape of the features. 
        Antarctica is much less distorted in this projection than in, say, WGS84.

    <h2>Pseudo-Mercator Projection</h2>
    <h3>The Pseudo-Mercator projection has size distortion towards the poles. One example of this is the size difference 
        between Alaska and Australia. On this map, they appear to be the same size but in reality, Australia is almost five
        times larger than Alaska.

    <h2>Sphere Winkel Projection</h2>
    <h3>The Sphere Winkel Projection is the arithmetic mean of the equirectangular projection and the 
        Aitoff projection, making it a balanced map in terms of size and shape distortion. There is still
        distortion in this map near the poles, but it is still useful for its fairly-accurate dimensions.

    <h2>World Cylindrical Equal Area Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection preserves area and size throughout the map but forgoes shape and distance in doing so.
        This can be seen in simply how distorted the polar regions of the map are compared to a projection that 
        preserves shape instead.
    </h3>

    <h2>World Equidistant Conical Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection is different from the rest because instead of a rectangular map it is circular.
        The center of the map is the north pole and all the meridian lines extend equidistantly from one 
        another to the edge of the projection. This projection greatly distorts shape and size, which can
        clearly be seen with Antarctica as it is wrapped around the projection like a ring. 
    </h3>

    </a>
    <h2>North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection is similar to the World Equidistant Conical Projections because it also uses the 
        North Pole as a center point. One advantage to this map is that all points on this map are at proportionally
        correct distances from the pole or center.

    <h2>Eckert II Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection is interesting because it uses only straight lines for lattitude and longitude.
        Also, it has a distinct hexagonal shape around the perimeter. This is also and equal-area projection.
    </h3>

    </a>
    <h2>Miller Cylindical Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection is similar to other cylindical projections. The main difference is that the Miller Cylindrical
        projection shows the polar regions in more detail. It is essentially an elongated version of the Cylindical
        Equal Area Projection above.
